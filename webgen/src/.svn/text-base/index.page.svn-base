h1. Welcome

Lazibi is a pre-processor that allows one to use Python style indenting in Ruby.

h1. Examples

Sweeter RSpec [ Thanks Jay ]

{includeFile: {filename: code/examples/rspec.py.rb, highlight: ruby, escapeHTML: false}}


Even sexier migrations ( with sexy_migration Rails plugin )

{includeFile: {filename: code/examples/migration.py.rb, highlight: ruby, escapeHTML: false}}

h1. How?

<pre>
Beauty -----------------> Simply  <-------- Your workspace
  ^                         /
   \        Lazibi         /
    \                     /
     \                   /
      <----- Ruby ------<
              |   \
              |    \----------------->  SVN
              |
              |
         |``````````|
         | autotest |
         |..........|
</pre>

h1. Ideals

Plug/unplug Lazibi should not matter. Ruby code stays the same in SCM.

Meta language definition should be customizable.

h1. Scaffold a new project

<pre>
mkdir shiny_project
cd shiny_project

lazibi
</pre>

create .py.rb files in corresponding directories inside 'meta', .rb files will be created and updated in 'real' as usual

h1. Exclude certain directories

Make sure Lazibi is running, edit lazibi_config.py.rb in project/meta/config/, restart Lazibi. For example:

<pre>
def exclude
  ['^vendor', 'tmp']
</pre>

h1. RSpec taste

Edit lazibi_config.py.rb as before. For example:

<pre>
def filters
  {:optional_do => ['^spec', '^dsl'], :optional_end => ['']}
</pre>

Personally I would not recommend using this filter outside the context of RSpec.

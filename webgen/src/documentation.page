h1. Usage

Bootstrap

<pre>
mkdir shiny_project
cd shiny_project
# put trunk in real
svn co $svn_path/shiny_project/trunk real
lazibi
</pre>

<pre>
_start_a_new_terminal_
cd shiny_project/real
rake test / autotest
</pre>

Start hacking in meta :/

<pre>
cd shiny_project
$your_editor meta
</pre>


h1. In Practice

Lazibi is written using Lazibi. "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/ is a must have, and Lazibi works well with TDD / RSpec.

A few projects are used as test code:

ActiveRecord, ActionMailer, ActionPack, ActiveSupport, Mongrel, RSpec, redMine.

h1. Known issues

Here docs, eval, javascript related libs, and complex string evaluation are currently not supported. 
Ruby code with above syntax will be preserved as is. So your code should still works, just no parse.
